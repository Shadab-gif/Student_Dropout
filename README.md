# Student_Dropout_Prediction & Analysis

##   Overview
This project investigates the critical factors leading to student dropout in higher education institutions. Through data exploration, machine learning, and statistical modeling, we uncover patterns and risk factors that contribute to attrition.

##   Objectives
- Identify students at high risk of dropping out
- Analyze key predictors: academic, financial, and demographic
- Build a predictive model to help with early intervention
- Recommend actionable strategies for institutions

##   Hypotheses Tested
- Students with **unpaid tuition** are more likely to drop out
- Poor academic performance in early semesters increases dropout risk
- Certain programs (e.g., **Mechanical/Civil Engineering**) have higher dropout rates

##   Key Findings
###   Descriptive Insights
- Dropouts are more frequent in **engineering & social sciences**
- **Female students** face higher dropout rates (45%) vs males (25%) despite lower total numbers
- **Financial strain** (unpaid tuition) leads to **86.6% dropout**, vs 24.7% for those who paid

###   Diagnostic & Predictive Results
- **2nd semester grades**, **tuition status**, and **evaluation participation** are top predictors
- Students with grades < 10 in early semesters show high dropout risk

###   Model Metrics
-  Accuracy:  85%  
-  Precision:  86%  
-  Recall:  70%  
-  F1 Score:  77%  

##   Tools & Technologies
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, SHAP
- PDF report & presentation formats

##   Recommendations
- Provide financial aid to students with unpaid tuition fees
- Early academic support for students with low 1st-semester grades
- Improve support in high-risk programs (e.g., Mechanical, Civil)
- Targeted engagement for female students

##   Future Improvements
- Deploy model with Streamlit for live dropout prediction
- Add more granular features like attendance, engagement scores
- Integrate real-time intervention triggers via dashboards
